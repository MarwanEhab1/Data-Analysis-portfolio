# Data Analysis Portfolio

This repository contains my data analysis projects using Microsoft Excel And Sql Server.
Project Description:

Performed data analysis using Excel by cleaning and transforming data with Power Query, creating Pivot Tables to calculate key performance indicators (KPIs), and building an interactive dashboard with charts and filters. The goal was to extract insights to support data-driven decision-making.

SQL Server Work:

Designed and created relational tables in SQL Server, inserted and managed data, and performed advanced queries using JOINs, GROUP BY, and subqueries to prepare the dataset for analysis.
